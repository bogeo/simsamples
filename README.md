# Dynamic simulation model examples

These Java classes realize some simple dynamic simulation models. 
The framework has been developed using JDK 1.6.

## Basic modeling approaches
* Difference equation based simulation
* Cellular Automata referring to discrete state-sets
* Cellular elevation grid (still experimental)
* Simple circuit analysis (node voltage analysis)
* Simple agent-based evolutionary example

## Example applications
Find the executable samples in the package de.hsbo.geo.simsamples.applications.

* Simulation of simple physical systems described by differential equations (numerical solution): Bouncing ball, Mass-spring-damper system;
* Simple model showing demographic development (population pyramid) controlled by birth and mortality rates;
* Simple predator prey system (Lotka-Volterra model);
* Simple population dynamics (Verhulst model);
* Cellular population development model; 
* "Game of Life" as prominent Cellular Automaton;
* Cellular elevation grid examples (evolutionary optimum finding algorithm, simple erosion model);
* Simple transient circuit simulation (step response if a resistor-capacitor-element).
