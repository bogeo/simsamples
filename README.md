# Dynamic simulation model examples

These Java classes realize some simple dynamic simulation models. 

Find the executable samples in the package de.hsbo.geo.simsamples.applications.

## Basic modeling approaches
* Difference equation based simulation
* Cellular Automata referring to discrete state-sets
* Cellular elevation grid (still experimental)
* Simple circuit analysis (node voltage analysis)
* Simple agent-based evolutionary example

The framework has been developed using JDK 1.6.
